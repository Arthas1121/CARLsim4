CARLsim is an efficient, easy-to-use, GPU-accelerated library for simulating large-scale spiking neural network (SNN) models with a high degree of biological detail.

CARLsim is also available from: http://socsci.uci.edu/~jkrichma/CARLsim/.

For a list of all people who have contributed to this project, please refer to 
AUTHORS.

For more detailed installation instructions, please refer to INSTALL.

For a log of source code changes, refer to CHANGELOG.

For a description of added features please refer to the RELEASE_NOTES.

### REQUIREMENTS
**Operating System**: Windows/Linux/MacOS (for a complete list of supported OS’s
see the INSTALL file)

**Software**: NVIDIA CUDA drivers/toolkits/SDKs version 6.0 and up shold be installed and
configured correctly.

**Hardware**: An NVIDIA CUDA-capable GPU device with a compute capability of 3.5
or higher is required.

### QUICKSTART INSTALLATION
**For Linux**:
Set the required environment variables in your .bashrc file. They are described
below:

`CARLSIM4_INSTALL_DIR`: desired installation location of the CARLsim library, the default is /usr/local
`CUDA_PATH`:  location of CUDA installation

You can copy and paste the below code into your .bashrc file replacing their
values with values appropriate for your system.

```
# set CARLsim variables
export CARLSIM4_INSTALL_DIR=/home/USER_NAME
export CUDA_PATH=/usr/local/cuda
```

Enter the unzipped CARLsim directory (same directory in which this README is
located) and run the following:

```
make && sudo make install
```

This will compile and install the CARLsim library.

Note: ‘sudo’ is only necessary when installing CARLsim in a location other than
your home directory.

**For Windows**:

On Windows platform, CARLsim4 includes a solution file and project files for each examples and
regression suite. For more information, please see \ref ch11_regression_suite. The solution file
was created by Visual Studio (VS) 2015 with CUDA 8.0. If you happen to use the same version,
<tt>Build Solution</tt> in VS 2015 will generate all executables (.exe) and static library
(.lib) for you. Before buiding the solution or projects, please make sure <tt>Configuration</tt>
is set to <tt>x64</tt> and <tt>Release</tt> for example executables and <tt>Debug</tt> for
regression suite.

* Main directory - contains the Makefile, documentation files, and other
directories.

* carlsim - contains the source code of CARLsim.

* doc - location of user-guide, tutorial, and source code for documentation.

* projects - meant to contain user’s CARLsim projects, all it is not
necessary to place project code here as long as the user.mk is configured
correctly and the CARLsim library is installed.

* tools - contains additional tools to be used with CARLsim.

### CARLSIM PROJECT DEVELOPMENT
To compile a project from the library, please copy the template makefile, make, and run.

```
cd projects/
./init.sh my_project
cd my_project
make
./my_project
```

### DOCUMENTATION
The documentation is already generated and can be found in doc/html. It can be
accessed by opening index.html in a web browswer. In Linux, documentation
can be generated by entering the ‘doc’ directory and typing `./makedoc`.
Currently, we have a user-guide, a tutorial, an FAQ, and doxygen-generated
source code documentation.

### Using the CARLsim testing framework
CARLsim uses the googletest framework v1.7 for testing. For more information
on googltest please visit the website at https://code.google.com/p/googletest/.
For a quick primer, visit: https://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/Primer.

After google tests has been installed:

1) From the carlsim/test directory of the CARLsim installation, type:

```
make
```

which compiles the carlsim tests

2) To run the tests, run ‘carlsim_tests’:

```
./carlsim_tests
```

This runs the CARLsim tests which should all pass. If they do not pass,
you may have inadvertantly modified the source code and should probably
redownload CARLsim.

3) To delete all testing output files type:

...
make distclean
...

### FAQ
1. **Why do I need to have CUDA installed for CARLsim’s CPU mode?**

CARLsim was written primarily as a GPU SNN simulator with the CPU mode being
used mainly for validation and prototyping. Because of this, code for the CPU
and GPU mode is intermingled. CARLsim v4.0 will separate these code-bases
completely.

2. **I’m having trouble installing CUDA in Linux. Any tips?**

As of the writing of this README (2/2015) the CUDA driver/toolkit/SDK are all
installed with the same installation script/package.  Once ‘./deviceQuery’
returns valid information about your runtime and driver CUDA installation, you
are in business. There are often problems with NVIDIA driver conflicts and
other video drivers in a Linux install. Often times people purge all NVIDIA
packages before attempting to install CUDA.

Usually you have to add a few key environment variables to your .bashrc file.
Below we set the CUDA_HOME variable to where CUDA is installed. we then set my
LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable to the CUDA_HOME/lib64 directory. Finally, we point to
the location of the CUDA tools/compiler (nvcc) by setting the PATH variable to
the CUDA_HOME/bin directory.

```
# set CUDA variables
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${CUDA_HOME}/lib64
export PATH=$PATH:${CUDA_HOME}/bin
```

3. **How do I install the parameter-tuning tools?**

Instructions for installing the parameter-tuning tools can be found in their
respective directories in the tools directory. For example, if you want to
install the automated parameter-tuning interface using ECJ,the installation
instructions are located in tools/ecj_pti.

4. **How do I install Google Tests?**

In general you should:

1)  Download google tests and unzip them to a location of your choice.

2)  Edit the environment variables GTEST_DIR (in carlsim/configure.mk) and GTEST_LIB_DIR
    (in carlsim/test/gtest.mk). GTEST_DIR should point to the location of the
    unzipped google test source code that you  downloaded. GTEST_LIB_DIR
    should point to the location you want the compiled google test libraries
    to which you will be linking should be installed.
